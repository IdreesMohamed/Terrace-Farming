Shake the bottle vigorously before and during use to keep the mixture combined.",
      "Uses": "A broad-spectrum organic insecticide and fungicide. Spray thoroughly on all parts of the plant, including the undersides of leaves, in the early morning or late evening to avoid leaf burn. Use it to control pests like aphids, mealybugs, whiteflies, and spider mites, and diseases like powdery mildew. Apply once a week for treatment or every 15 days for prevention."
